## Overview
Welcome to the Capstone Project! This is your opportunity to synthesize the knowledge and skills gained throughout this book to design and implement a Physical AI agent for a humanoid robotics scenario. The project will be broken down into several phases, with each phase focusing on a critical aspect of development.

## Phase 1 Goal
To define the capstone project's problem, conduct initial research, and outline a high-level approach.

## Tasks
1.  **Select a Problem**: Choose a specific Physical AI problem involving humanoid robotics that you want to solve. This could be a manipulation task, a navigation challenge, a human-robot interaction scenario, or a combination. Consider problems that allow you to integrate concepts from ROS 2, simulation (Gazebo/Isaac Sim), NVIDIA Isaac (Jetson/Isaac ROS), and VLA.
2.  **Define Project Scope**: Clearly articulate the boundaries of your project. What will your robot do? What will it *not* do? What are the key success metrics?
3.  **Literature Review**: Conduct a brief literature review to understand existing solutions, relevant research papers, and potential technologies.
4.  **High-Level Architecture Sketch**: Sketch a high-level block diagram of your proposed system architecture, indicating the main components and how they will interact (e.g., perception module, planning module, control module, language interface).
5.  **Identify Key Challenges**: List the major technical challenges you anticipate encountering during the project and brainstorm initial ideas for how to address them.

## Deliverables for Phase 1
-   A document (e.g., `phase1_report.md` in your project's `docs` folder) containing:
    *   **Problem Statement**: Clear and concise description of the problem.
    *   **Project Scope**: What's in and out of scope.
    *   **Research Summary**: Key findings from your literature review.
    *   **Architecture Sketch**: High-level system diagram.
    *   **Challenge Identification**: List of anticipated technical challenges.

## Submission
Submit your `phase1_report.md` by the end of Week 8.
