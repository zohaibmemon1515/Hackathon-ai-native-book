## Overview
These guidelines provide essential information for preparing and submitting your Capstone Project deliverables. Adhering to these guidelines ensures fair evaluation and proper presentation of your work.

## General Requirements

*   **Repository Structure**: All project files (code, reports, models, etc.) must be organized within a clearly structured GitHub repository.
*   **README.md**: Your repository must include a comprehensive `README.md` file at the root. This file should:
    *   Clearly state the project's title and your name.
    *   Provide a brief overview of your Physical AI agent and its goal.
    *   Include instructions on how to set up, build, and run your project (both the code and the Docusaurus book content, if applicable).
    *   Link to your Docusaurus book's deployed GitHub Pages site.
*   **Documentation**: All code should be well-commented. Any custom Docusaurus book content you create should follow the formatting and style guidelines established in the main book content.
*   **Academic Integrity**: All work must be your own. Proper citation of all external resources (code libraries, research papers, datasets) is mandatory using APA style. Plagiarism will result in a failing grade.

## Deliverables

Your final Capstone Project submission should include the following:

1.  **Project Report (`final_report.md`)**:
    *   Located in your project's `docs` folder.
    *   **Content**: Detailed description of your agent's design, implementation, evaluation methodology, results, challenges encountered, and future work.
    *   **Formatting**: Adhere to Markdown (Docusaurus-compatible) with proper APA-style citations for all references.
    *   **Length**: Approximately 2000-3000 words (excluding references).
2.  **Source Code**:
    *   All ROS 2 packages, simulation configuration files, and any custom scripts developed for your Physical AI agent.
    *   The code must be functional and runnable according to your `README.md` instructions.
3.  **Demonstration Video**:
    *   A 5-10 minute video demonstrating your Physical AI agent's capabilities in the simulated environment.
    *   The video should clearly showcase the robot achieving its primary goals, and ideally, addressing some of the challenges you identified.
    *   Upload the video to a platform like YouTube or Vimeo and provide a link in your `README.md` and `final_report.md`.
4.  **Docusaurus Book Link**:
    *   A link to your deployed Docusaurus site on GitHub Pages, containing your `final_report.md` as a navigable page.

## Submission Process

1.  Ensure all your deliverables are pushed to your designated GitHub repository.
2.  Make sure your `README.md` is up-to-date with all necessary links and instructions.
3.  Submit the URL of your GitHub repository via the designated course submission portal by the deadline.

## Grading Criteria

Your Capstone Project will be evaluated based on:

*   **Problem Understanding and Scope**: Clarity and relevance of the problem addressed.
*   **Design and Implementation**: Quality, correctness, and elegance of your agent's design and code.
*   **Simulation Prototyping**: Effectiveness of your simulation setup and demonstration of core functionalities.
*   **Evaluation and Results**: Rigor of your evaluation, clarity of results, and insightful discussion.
*   **Technical Communication**: Quality of your project report, code documentation, and demonstration video.
*   **Innovation and Creativity**: Originality of your approach or problem tackled.
*   **Adherence to Guidelines**: Compliance with all submission requirements.

Good luck with your Capstone Project!
