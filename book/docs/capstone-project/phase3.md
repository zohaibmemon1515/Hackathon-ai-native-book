title: 'Capstone Project - Phase 3: Integration and Evaluation'
sidebar_position: 3
---

## Overview
Phase 3 is where you bring all the components of your Physical AI agent together, integrate them into a cohesive system, and rigorously evaluate its performance against your defined success criteria. This phase focuses on robustness, performance, and the overall success of your robot in the simulated environment.

## Phase 3 Goal
To integrate all designed and prototyped components into a complete Physical AI agent, and thoroughly evaluate its performance in simulation.

## Tasks
1.  **Full System Integration**:
    *   Integrate all perception, planning, control, and (if applicable) VLA modules into a single, functional system.
    *   Ensure seamless communication and data flow between all ROS 2 nodes and the simulated robot.
2.  **Robustness Testing**:
    *   Test your robot in various simulated scenarios, including edge cases and unexpected events (e.g., changes in lighting, dynamic obstacles, sensor noise).
    *   Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms.
3.  **Performance Evaluation**:
    *   Measure the robot's performance against your defined success criteria (e.g., task completion rate, execution time, accuracy of perception).
    *   Conduct quantitative analysis of your robot's behavior.
4.  **Refinement and Optimization**:
    *   Based on testing and evaluation, refine your algorithms and parameters to improve performance, robustness, and efficiency.
    *   Optimize code for better execution in the simulation environment.
5.  **Final Demonstration Preparation**:
    *   Prepare a compelling final demonstration of your Physical AI agent achieving its capstone project goal.

## Deliverables for Phase 3
-   A final project report (e.g., `final_report.md`) detailing:
    *   System architecture and implementation details.
    *   Integration challenges and solutions.
    *   Comprehensive evaluation results against success criteria.
    *   Discussion of robot performance, limitations, and future work.
-   All source code for your Physical AI agent (ROS 2 packages, simulation configurations).
-   A final demonstration video (5-10 minutes) showcasing your robot's capabilities and addressing key aspects of its performance.

## Submission
Submit your final project report, all source code, and your final demonstration video by the end of Week 12.
