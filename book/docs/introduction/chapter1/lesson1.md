## Learning Objectives
- Understand the definition and scope of Physical AI.
- Differentiate Physical AI from traditional AI.
- Recognize the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI.

## Concept Explanation
Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike purely software-based AI, Physical AI agents are embodied and must interact with real-world dynamics, physical constraints, and uncertainties. This field integrates concepts from robotics, control theory, machine learning, and cognitive science.

## Real-World Examples
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars navigating complex road conditions.
- **Humanoid Robots**: Robots performing tasks in human-centric environments.
- **Industrial Robotic Arms**: Robots in manufacturing plants performing assembly and manipulation.

## Mathematical or technical breakdown
Physical AI often involves control loops that integrate perception, decision-making, and actuation. A simplified control loop might look like:
`Perception (sensors) -> State Estimation -> Decision Making (AI/ML) -> Action Planning -> Actuation (motors)`

## Mini-Project
**Thought Experiment**: Imagine a simple robot whose task is to pick up a red ball from a table. What are the key sensing, reasoning, and acting components it would need?

## Summary
Physical AI is about building embodied intelligent agents that interact with the physical world, requiring a blend of AI, robotics, and control principles.
