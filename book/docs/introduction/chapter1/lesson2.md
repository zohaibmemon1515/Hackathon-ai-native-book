## Learning Objectives
- Grasp the concept of embodied intelligence.
- Understand how physical embodiment influences intelligence.
- Identify key principles underlying embodied intelligence.

## Concept Explanation
Embodied intelligence posits that an agent's intelligence is not solely a product of its brain or computational abilities, but is deeply intertwined with its physical body and its interactions with the environment. The physical form, sensory organs, and motor capabilities constrain and enable certain types of cognition and behavior.

Key principles include:
- **Sense-Act Cycle**: Continuous interaction between perception and action.
- **Morphological Computation**: The body's physical properties simplify control and computation.
- **Environment as a Resource**: The environment can be exploited to simplify tasks.

## Real-World Examples
- **Bipedal Locomotion**: The design of human legs inherently simplifies walking, rather than requiring complex computational control for every joint.
- **Soft Robotics**: The compliance of soft robots allows for robust gripping and manipulation without precise force control.

## Mathematical or technical breakdown
Consider a robot arm designed to grasp objects. The shape and compliance of its gripper (morphology) can reduce the need for highly accurate vision and complex control algorithms. The physical interaction provides direct feedback that simplifies the control problem.

## Mini-Project
**Design Challenge**: Design a simple robotic hand (on paper) that can grasp objects of varying shapes using minimal sensors and actuators, relying heavily on its physical design (embodiment).

## Summary
Embodied intelligence emphasizes the crucial role of the physical body and its interaction with the environment in shaping an agent's intelligence, often simplifying control problems through physical properties.
