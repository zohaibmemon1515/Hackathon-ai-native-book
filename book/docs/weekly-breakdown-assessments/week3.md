## Learning Objectives
- Understand ROS 2 Quality of Service (QoS) settings.
- Learn about time management in ROS 2, especially `ros_clock`.
- Explore debugging and logging in ROS 2.
- Understand Gazebo's architecture and spawn models.
- Learn to control a simulated robot in Gazebo via ROS 2.

## Readings
- "Understanding Quality of Service (QoS) Settings" (from `ros2/chapter2/lesson2.md`)
- "Managing Time in ROS 2" (from `ros2/chapter2/lesson3.md`)
- "Debugging and Logging in ROS 2" (from `ros2/chapter3/lesson3.md`)
- "Introduction to Gazebo for Robotics Simulation" (from `digital-twin-simulation/chapter2/lesson1.md`)
- "Integrating Digital Twins with ROS 2 and Real Hardware" (from `digital-twin-simulation/chapter1/lesson3.md`)

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **QoS Experiment**: Conduct the QoS experiment described in `ros2/chapter2/lesson2.md`, observing message reliability.
2.  **Gazebo Control**: Launch Gazebo and control a simple simulated robot using ROS 2 `Twist` messages, following instructions in `digital-twin-simulation/chapter1/lesson3.md`.
3.  **ROS 2 Logging**: Implement and experiment with the logging node from `ros2/chapter3/lesson3.md`.

## Assessment
-   **Practical Demonstration**: Demonstrate your Gazebo robot control.
-   **Discussion Prompt**: Discuss how QoS settings would be crucial for a robot operating in a safety-critical environment.

## Key Deliverables
-   Code for QoS experiment.
-   Code for Gazebo robot control.
-   Code for ROS 2 logging experiment.
