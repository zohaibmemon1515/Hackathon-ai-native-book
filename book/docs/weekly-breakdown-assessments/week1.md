sidebar_position: 1
---

## Learning Objectives
- Define Physical AI and its interdisciplinary nature.
- Understand embodied intelligence principles.
- Identify common physical constraints and real-world dynamics in robotics.
- Grasp basic ROS 2 concepts: nodes, topics, publishers, and subscribers.
- Learn to create and run simple ROS 2 nodes.

## Readings
- "What is Physical AI?" (from `introduction/chapter1/lesson1.md`)
- "Embodied Intelligence Principles" (from `introduction/chapter1/lesson2.md`)
- "Physical Constraints & Real-World Dynamics" (from `introduction/chapter1/lesson3.md`)
- "Understanding ROS 2 Nodes and Topics" (from `ros2/chapter1/lesson1.md`)
- ROS 2 Documentation: [Concepts](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html)

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **ROS 2 "Hello World"**: Create a `talker` and `listener` node pair in Python as described in `ros2/chapter1/lesson1.md`.
2.  **Thought Experiment**: Reflect on how Physical AI differs from traditional AI, providing an example from a domain not covered in the readings.

## Assessment
-   **Quiz 1**: Short multiple-choice and short-answer questions covering definitions and concepts of Physical AI and basic ROS 2 components.
-   **Discussion Prompt**: Discuss the implications of "embodied intelligence" for robot design. How would understanding embodiment change how you approach building a robot?

## Key Deliverables
-   Working ROS 2 `talker`/`listener` nodes.
-   Written response to the thought experiment.
