## Learning Objectives
- Explore Large Language Models (LLMs) in robotics and their grounding.
- Understand action planning and execution in VLA systems.
- Learn about humanoid robot morphology, kinematics, and whole-body control.
- Identify humanoid robot design principles and actuation technologies.
- Understand how to deploy and manage Edge AI models on robots.

## Readings
- "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Robotics" (from `vla-integration/chapter2/lesson1.md`)
- "Grounding Language to Robot Actions and Perceptions" (from `vla-integration/chapter2/lesson2.md`)
- "Action Planning and Execution in VLA Systems" (from `vla-integration/chapter2/lesson3.md`)
- "Humanoid Robot Morphology and Kinematics" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter3/lesson1.md`)
- "Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter3/lesson2.md`)
- "Humanoid Robot Design Principles and Actuation" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter3/lesson3.md`)
- "Deploying and Managing Edge AI Models on Robots" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter2/lesson3.md`)

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **LLM Prompt Design**: Design a prompt for a robot LLM as discussed in `vla-integration/chapter2/lesson1.md`.
2.  **Language Grounding Experiment Design**: Outline a language grounding experiment for a robot as per `vla-integration/chapter2/lesson2.md`.
3.  **Whole-Body Control Strategy**: Design a whole-body control strategy for a simple humanoid task based on `hardware-edge-ai/chapter3/lesson2.md`.

## Assessment
-   **Quiz 6**: Covers advanced VLA concepts, LLM integration, humanoid robotics hardware, and Edge AI deployment.
-   **Conceptual Design Review**: Present your LLM prompt, language grounding experiment, and whole-body control strategy designs.

## Key Deliverables
-   Written LLM prompt design.
-   Written language grounding experiment design.
-   Written whole-body control strategy design.
