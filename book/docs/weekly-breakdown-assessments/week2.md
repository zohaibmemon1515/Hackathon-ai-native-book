## Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between ROS 2 topics, services, and actions.
- Understand ROS 2 parameters and launch files for system configuration.
- Define digital twins and their benefits in robotics.
- Learn about robot description formats (URDF/SDF).

## Readings
- "ROS 2 Services and Actions" (from `ros2/chapter1/lesson2.md`)
- "Parameters and Launch Files" (from `ros2/chapter1/lesson3.md`)
- "Digital Twin Fundamentals and Benefits" (from `digital-twin-simulation/chapter1/lesson1.md`)
- "Designing and Implementing Robot Models for Simulation" (from `digital-twin-simulation/chapter1/lesson2.md`)
- ROS 2 Documentation: [Launch Files](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/Launch/Launch-system.html)

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **ROS 2 Service Implementation**: Implement a simple ROS 2 service as described in `ros2/chapter1/lesson2.md`.
2.  **URDF Model Creation**: Create a basic URDF model for a mobile robot (as discussed in `digital-twin-simulation/chapter1/lesson2.md`) and visualize it using `urdf_display` or `rviz`.

## Assessment
-   **Quiz 2**: Covers ROS 2 communication patterns, launch files, digital twin concepts, and robot modeling.
-   **Mini-Project Review**: Share your URDF model and discuss its components.

## Key Deliverables
-   Working ROS 2 service client/server.
-   A valid URDF file for a simple mobile robot.
