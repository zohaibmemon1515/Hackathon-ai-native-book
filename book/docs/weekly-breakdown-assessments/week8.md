## Learning Objectives
- Review all concepts learned throughout the course.
- Understand the requirements and phases of the capstone project.
- Begin preliminary planning for your humanoid robotics capstone project.
- Explore multimodal fusion and VLA evaluation techniques.

## Readings
- "Multimodal Fusion in VLA Systems" (from `vla-integration/chapter3/lesson1.md`)
- "Building End-to-End VLA Architectures" (from `vla-integration/chapter3/lesson2.md`)
- "Evaluating and Benchmarking VLA Systems" (from `vla-integration/chapter3/lesson3.md`)
- Review all previous module `index.md` and chapter `_category_.json` files.

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **Project Brainstorming**: Brainstorm ideas for your capstone project, considering the various technologies and concepts covered in the book.
2.  **Multimodal Fusion Conceptualization**: Conceptualize multimodal fusion for object referencing based on `vla-integration/chapter3/lesson1.md`.
3.  **End-to-End VLA Architecture Design**: Design an end-to-end VLA architecture for a simple task as per `vla-integration/chapter3/lesson2.md`.
4.  **VLA Evaluation Criteria Development**: Develop evaluation criteria for a simple VLA task based on `vla-integration/chapter3/lesson3.md`.

## Assessment
-   **Capstone Project Proposal**: Submit a brief proposal outlining your capstone project idea, including its goals, key technologies to be used, and a preliminary plan.
-   **Discussion**: Discuss the challenges and opportunities in building an end-to-end VLA system and how you plan to evaluate your capstone project.

## Key Deliverables
-   A draft capstone project proposal.
-   Written conceptual designs for multimodal fusion, end-to-end VLA architecture, and VLA evaluation criteria.
