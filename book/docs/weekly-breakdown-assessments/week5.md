## Learning Objectives
- Explore high-fidelity physics and graphics with Isaac Sim.
- Learn to integrate Isaac Sim with ROS 2.
- Understand synthetic data generation and domain randomization in Isaac Sim.
- Comprehend the motivation and benefits of Isaac ROS.
- Learn about GPU-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS.

## Readings
- "High-Fidelity Physics and Graphics with Isaac Sim" (from `nvidia-isaac/chapter2/lesson1.md`)
- "Integrating Isaac Sim with ROS 2" (from `nvidia-isaac/chapter2/lesson2.md`)
- "Synthetic Data Generation and Domain Randomization in Isaac Sim" (from `nvidia-isaac/chapter2/lesson3.md`)
- "Understanding Isaac ROS and GPU Acceleration" (from `nvidia-isaac/chapter3/lesson1.md`)
- "Implementing GPU-Accelerated Perception with Isaac ROS" (from `nvidia-isaac/chapter3/lesson2.md`)

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **Isaac Sim Scene Exploration**: Launch Isaac Sim and explore a sample scene as described in `nvidia-isaac/chapter2/lesson1.md`.
2.  **ROS 2 Control in Isaac Sim**: Conceptually outline how to control a simulated robot in Isaac Sim using ROS 2, as per `nvidia-isaac/chapter2/lesson2.md`.
3.  **Domain Randomization in Isaac Sim Thought Experiment**: Design a conceptual experiment for synthetic image generation with domain randomization in Isaac Sim based on `nvidia-isaac/chapter2/lesson3.md`.

## Assessment
-   **Quiz 4**: Covers Isaac Sim capabilities, integration with ROS 2, Isaac ROS concepts, and GPU-accelerated perception.
-   **Conceptual Design Review**: Present your conceptual designs for ROS 2 control and domain randomization in Isaac Sim.

## Key Deliverables
-   Written conceptual designs for Isaac Sim ROS 2 control and domain randomization.
