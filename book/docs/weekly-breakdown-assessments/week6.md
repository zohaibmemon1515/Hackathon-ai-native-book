## Learning Objectives
- Define Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and its significance.
- Understand visual perception and natural language understanding for VLA.
- Explore Edge AI for robotics and the NVIDIA Jetson platforms.
- Learn about foundational hardware components: sensors, actuators, microcontrollers.

## Readings
- "Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)" (from `vla-integration/chapter1/lesson1.md`)
- "Visual Perception for VLA Systems" (from `vla-integration/chapter1/lesson2.md`)
- "Natural Language Understanding for VLA" (from `vla-integration/chapter1/lesson3.md`)
- "Introduction to Edge AI for Robotics" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter2/lesson1.md`)
- "NVIDIA Jetson for Edge AI Robotics" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter2/lesson2.md`)
- "Sensors for Robot Perception" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter1/lesson1.md`)
- "Actuators for Robot Motion and Manipulation" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter1/lesson2.md`)
- "Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems for Robotics" (from `hardware-edge-ai/chapter1/lesson3.md`)

## Hands-on Activities
1.  **VLA Command Deconstruction**: Deconstruct a VLA command conceptually as described in `vla-integration/chapter1/lesson1.md`.
2.  **Edge AI Opportunities Identification**: Identify Edge AI opportunities in a robotic task based on `hardware-edge-ai/chapter2/lesson1.md`.
3.  **Microcontroller Motor Control**: Conceptually outline the implementation of a microcontroller for motor control as per `hardware-edge-ai/chapter1/lesson3.md`.

## Assessment
-   **Quiz 5**: Covers VLA fundamentals, Edge AI concepts, Jetson platforms, and basic robotics hardware.
-   **Conceptual Design Review**: Discuss your VLA command deconstruction and Edge AI opportunity identification.

## Key Deliverables
-   Written deconstruction of a VLA command.
-   Written identification of Edge AI opportunities.
-   Written conceptual design for microcontroller motor control.
