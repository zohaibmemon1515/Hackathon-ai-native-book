# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This repository contains the source code and content for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book", a Docusaurus-based learning resource for students and educators.

## Project Goal

To create a production-ready Docusaurus book covering Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence, and Humanoid Robotics, structured into chapters and lessons, deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

The book content is organized into modules, chapters, and lessons within the `book/docs` directory. Custom React components for advanced visualizations are in `book/src/components`, and static assets like images are stored in `book/static/images`.

## Development

This project is developed using Spec-Kit-Plus. The `specs/1-ai-robotics-book/` directory contains the specification, plan, research, and tasks for this book.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd book
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without restarting the server.
4.  **Build static content:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.
