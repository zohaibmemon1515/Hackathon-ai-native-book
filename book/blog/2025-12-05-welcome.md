Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book!

This book is designed for computer science students and educators interested in the fascinating world of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. Over the coming weeks, we will explore core concepts, practical applications using ROS 2, advanced simulations with NVIDIA Isaac, and the integration of cutting-edge AI techniques like Vision-Language-Action models for humanoid robots.

Our goal is to provide you with a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience, culminating in a capstone project where you'll build and control your own Physical AI agent in a simulated environment.

Stay tuned for updates and new content!
